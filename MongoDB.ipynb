    "# Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "# A : MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility for handling large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. It is a document-oriented database, where data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents instead of traditional rows and columns.\n",
    "#     Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data\n",
    "# UseCases :     \n",
    "# Big Data and real-time analytics: MongoDB's flexible document model makes it suitable for handling large volumes of dynamic and rapidly changing data, which is common in big data and real-time analytics scenarios.\n",
    "# Agile development: MongoDB's schema flexibility allows for faster development cycles, as changes to the data model can be made without modifying the entire database schema.\n",
    "# Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with built-in sharding, allowing for seamless distribution of data across multiple servers to handle high traffic and large datasets."

    "# Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "# A : Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, self-describing JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). These documents can have varying structures, allowing for schema flexibility and easy handling of polymorphic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability through sharding, which allows data to be distributed across multiple servers. It can handle large datasets and high traffic by automatically balancing the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High Performance: MongoDB uses memory mapping and provides high-speed read and write operations. It also supports indexing, replication, and caching, resulting in efficient data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High Availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replica sets for high availability. Replica sets consist of primary and secondary nodes, ensuring data redundancy and automatic promotion of a new primary in case of failures\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flexible Deployment: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, supporting various operating systems and cloud platforms. It also integrates well with popular programming languages and frameworks."
