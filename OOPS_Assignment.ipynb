    "   Example : \n",

    "A : Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. By encapsulating data and methods, we can ensure that they are accessed and modified through well-defined channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or superclass, while the class that inherits those properties is called the derived class or subclass. \n",

    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of hiding unnecessary details and providing a simplified representation of complex systems. In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for its subclasses."
